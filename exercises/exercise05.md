- Name: Terry Konkin
- Course: Database for Analytics
- Module: 5
- Database Used:  `sqlda` (Sample Datasets)
- Tools Used: PostgreSQL (pgAdmin or psql)

## Instructions

- Use the **sqlda** database from the "Loading the Sample Datasets" instructions.
- For each SQL task:
  - Include your SQL in a fenced code block
  - Execute it and include a **screenshot** showing the query and results
- Store screenshots in the `screenshots/` folder and embed them below each answer.
- For explanation questions:
  - Write your answer in complete sentences
  - Include a screenshot if requested

## Question 1

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed to show a **list of years** that emails were sent.

Your results should list years like this (order matters):

```
year
2011
2013
2014
2015
2016
2017
2018
2019
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sent_date) AS year
FROM emails
ORDER BY year;
```

## Question 2

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed to show the **number of messages sent by year**, ordered by year (as shown in the prompt).

Output should resemble:

```
count   year
...
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS count,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sent_date) AS year
FROM emails
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;
```

## Question 3

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed to show:
- the **sent date**
- the **opened date**
- the **interval** between the two

Only include emails that contain **both** a sent date and an opened date.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT
    sent_date,
    opened_date,
    opened_date - sent_date AS interval
FROM emails
WHERE sent_date IS NOT NULL
  AND opened_date IS NOT NULL;
```

## Question 4

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed to show emails that contain an **opened date BEFORE the sent date**.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT
    sent_date,
    opened_date
FROM emails
WHERE opened_date < sent_date;
```

## Question 5

Using the `sqlda` database: there are **over 100 emails** that contain an opened date **BEFORE** the sent date.

After looking at the data, **why is this the case?**

### Answer

Since it is physically impossible to open an email prior to it being sent, the output would represent bad or unreliable data that should not be utilized.  The primary cause for this would likely be an error in entering the data.  It is notable that all rows in the sent column indicate an identical time (1500), so the specific cause may be pursued in that area.

## Question 6

Using the `sqlda` database, explain in your own words what the following code does:

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_points AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        point(longitude, latitude) AS lng_lat_point
    FROM customers
    WHERE longitude IS NOT NULL
    AND latitude IS NOT NULL
);

CREATE TEMP TABLE dealership_points AS (
    SELECT
        dealership_id,
        point(longitude, latitude) AS lng_lat_point
    FROM dealerships
);

CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_dealership_distance AS (
    SELECT
       customer_id,
       dealership_id,
       c.lng_lat_point <@> d.lng_lat_point AS distance
    FROM customer_points c
    CROSS JOIN dealership_points d
);
```
*First Statement*
Creates a tenporary table called customer_points.
The table will have 2 columns named customer_id (from the customer table) and lng_lat_point.
The values in the lng_lat_point column are generated by displaying the values from both the longitude and latitude columns together inside parentheses.

*Second Statement*
This is the same as the first statement, generating location points for dealerships rather than customers.  As with the first statement, it creates a temporary table, this time titled dealership_points.  The first column is dealership_id (from the dealerships table).  The second column is also named lng_lat_point, but utilizes the latitude and longitude values from the dealerships table. 

*Third Statement*
This statement uses the location points for customers and dealerships that were generated from the previous two statements.  The distance between every customer/dealership combination is then calculated.  The calculated results are then displayed in the temporary table that was created.

## Question 7

Using the `sqlda` database, write SQL to display an **array of salespeople for each dealership**, sorted by dealership.

For example - dealership 1 is below:

```text
"{""Fidell,Granville"",""Onele,Jereme"",""Sheriff,Lelia"",""McSpirron,Massimiliano"",""Rennick,Nadia"",""Mace,Eveleen"",""Oxteby,Dukie"",""Spong,Marcos"",""Wogden,Quent"",""Duny,Sandye"",""Loraine,Englebert"",""Meere,Ira"",""Gibbens,Cristine"",""Prine,Lyda"",""McCoughan,Sheff"",""Schule,Giselbert"",""McAndie,Eleen"",""Dosedale,Dorie"",""Nafziger,Shay""}"
```

### SQL

```

SELECT
    dealership_id,
    ARRAY_AGG(last_name || ',' || first_name) AS salespeople
FROM salespeople
GROUP BY dealership_id
ORDER BY dealership_id;

```

## Question 8

Using the `sqlda` database, write SQL to display:
- an **array of salespeople for each dealership**
- the **state** of the dealership
- the **number of salespeople** for the dealership

Sort by **state**.

Reference image:

![05-ExerciseArray](./instructions/05-ExerciseArray.jpg)

### SQL

```sql
SELECT
    dealerships.dealership_id,
    dealerships.state,
    COUNT(salespeople.salesperson_id) AS count,
    ARRAY_AGG(salespeople.last_name || ',' || salespeople.first_name) AS salespeople_agg
FROM dealerships
JOIN salespeople ON dealerships.dealership_id = salespeople.dealership_id
GROUP BY dealerships.dealership_id, dealerships.state
ORDER BY dealerships.state;
```

## Question 9

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed to convert the **customers** table to **JSON**.

### SQL

```sql
-- Your SQL here
```

## Question 10

Using the `sqlda` database, write SQL to display:
- an **array of salespeople for each dealership**
- the **state**
- the **number of salespeople**
- sorted by **state**

Then **convert this result to JSON**.
